# Renewable Energy: Big Data Analyzer Tool
<br><br>
This is a Big Data tool/project to estimate whether a US state can increase it's wind energy production (Using the difference between current wind energy produced and the possible wind energy that can produce if you build more Wind farms; using available terrain data), including possible nuclear energy usage reduction and perfoming a comparison between 'Energy Produced' and 'Energy Consumption'. This project obstains data from available open data from the US Government.
